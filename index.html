            <p>Internet bots are programs created to do repetitive tasks that a human wouldn't normally be 
            willing to do. This can include automatic posting, replying, and liking/disliking posts en masse. They are very 
            powerful tools that can be used to reach out to thousands of people via the internet. An internet bot doesn't inherently have a bias but when it gets into the hands of a person who does, it can be used to amplify their views tremendously. When bots infiltrate a community, they are designed to hide themselves as real people and simulate genuine online activity. A person might not know when they're interacting with a bot or not.
