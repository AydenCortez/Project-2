                    <p>Looking at the graph just below this, internet bots are more popular and prevalent in websites with low credibility and merit behind their information. Even though bots can also be used to spread credible information, they are usually used to promote misinformation. If this trend continues, it will be much harder to distinguish between good and bad information.

                    <p>It's hard to imagine such a simple program having the potential to cause this much harm to social media but when it seems to be under the radar for quite some time, it begins to make more sense. The bot problem was allowed to grow to such an extent that it poses a threat to virtually every mainstream social media and news sources. Most experts on botting stress that it is imperative that we learn to detect these bots better to prevent from taking in false or misleading information. To simply put it, we just need to be a bit skeptical of the information put out. One might also be able to spot a bot by quickly looking at their post or reply history and see if a normal human could have that history or post frequency. There are also bot detection softwares under development currently that may help with the issue as well. It seems that internet bots are here to stay and we must remain vigilant of this.
